# Tech Blog

This app is in progress. I am working on this User Story:

AS A developer who writes about tech
I WANT a CMS-style blog site
SO THAT I can publish articles, blog posts, and my thoughts and opinions

This app will use the Model-View-Controller (MVC) paradigm. It will also use:
- Handlebars.js for Views
- MySQL2 and Sequelize to connect to a database for Models
- Express.js API for Controllers
- Dotenv to use environmental variables
- Bcrypt to hash passwords
- Express Session and cookies for authentication
- Heroku for deployment

Stay tuned for the final project. Thank you.
